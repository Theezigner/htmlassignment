Hello, Alt School Africa!

00:00:02.932 --> 00:00:07.448
My name is Temitayo Adebayo, and I'm excited to share
my video assignment with you.

00:00:07.668 --> 00:00:13.345
I'm currently on the Frontend Engineering Track,
and this project is part of our HTML Assignment 2.

00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:19.881
In this video, I'll be showcasing the skills and techniques
I've learned in HTML so far.

00:00:20.217 --> 00:00:25.430
We'll explore various elements and structures that
are essential for creating dynamic and engaging web

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.161
pages.

00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:30.491
This assignment has been a great opportunity to apply
my knowledge practically.

00:00:32.292 --> 00:00:36.146

Assignment 2.

00:00:36.296 --> 00:00:38.804

00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:44.201
I'm eager to continue learning and growing in the
Frontend Engineering Track at Alt School Africa.
